        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <h3>Designing for your AUDIENCE:</h3>
          <p> You need to know who your target audience is. A target audience is a group of people that have something in common,
            and it greatly influences many design aspects.</p>
          <p> Think about the type of people you want to engage. Make notes about things like age, family status, computer experience
            and interests or hobbies.</p>
          <h4> Ask yourself:</h4>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>How old are these people? </li>
            <li>Do they have a lot of family obligations? </li>
            <li>Do they have a particular career path? </li>
            <li>How often are they online? </li>
            <li>What are their hobbies?</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Write a general description of your user.</p>
          <p> The <strong>target audience</strong> is important because it helps to answer a bunch of design questions you’re going to have.</p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Age range:</strong>
              Could impact color scheme, text size, and language used.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Level of computer experience:</strong>
              Impacts viewer’s ability to interact with the site. What are they used to in terms of site design?</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hobbies/Interests/Pastimes:</strong>
              May help to gear and guide the taste of the site as well as point views to other resources within these interests that they enjoy.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h3> Content</h3>
          <p> Write all the content bits and pieces out on little pieces of paper. Then, categorize the pieces. This exercise will give you a logical global navigation (and subnavigation if you have lots of content).</p>
          <p> There’s no one way to organize content. You need to have a feel for what your content is, and then categorize
            pieces together. Don’t forget, it’s easier to rearrange pieces of paper than electronic data.</p>
          <p> This process doesn’t just help the organization of content, it also helps you begin to think about production resources you will need and a time plan.
          <p>
          <h3> Navigation</h3>
          <p> If you’ve worked through the content section, you’ll know that Navigation relies quite heavily on the content. Organizing
            content will reveal logical global and sub navigation. What comes first? Create a hierarchy for your content.</p>
          <p> The site map shows exactly how many navigational items you’ll need as well as the hierarchy of the pages. The creation
            of a site map will also help you eliminate irrelevant content and know what you need to produce. It’s a good
            idea to take your time with this because without it, it will quickly become confusing where a particular piece of content
            “lives”. A simple and clear navigation structure is important so that your users don’t get confused or frustrated.</p>

          <h2>Planning a Web Native Film: SVT</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          
          <p> <img src="img/story/SVT_cycle.png" width="500px"/> To help plan a web native film, we recommend a model called “SVT” (or Story, Vision, Tech). This cyclical model begins with <strong>the story</strong>. Technology
            can serve as inspiration, but <strong>never substitute for a story</strong>. Your number
            one job is to tell a story. <strong>Never forget it!</strong></p>
          <h3>Story</h3>
          <p> What is your story about? Who are your characters? What are their motivations?
            Why should your viewers care? In web-native stories and traditional
            stories alike, story matters!</p>
          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>After you have the story, think about how you’d want your user to experience
            that story. How do you envision a viewer interacting with your web
            native film? What are the unique characteristics of the web (like participation,
            or interactivity) that can help you tell your story more effectively?
            You’ll need to bring a creative vision that serves as the expression of your
            story.</p>
            <div class="modalFloaterRight">
            <h4>Information Architecture
              &amp; Procedural Storytelling</h4>
            <p>Here are two concepts that apply
              specially to web-native stories: <strong>information
              architecture</strong> and <strong>procedural
              storytelling.</strong></p>
            <p> <strong>Information architecture</strong> refers to
              the way your app is structured. If you
              were making a traditional film, you’d
              need a basic information architecture
              to keep track of your notes, research,
              and footage. But the finished film requires
              no such architecture, since it’s a
              flat 90 minute film.</p>
            <p> <strong>A web-native film is in</strong> a piece of
              software so it needs an information
              architecture. Information architecture
              is simply a system of organization
              that takes into account both how you
              present information and how a user
              accesses that information.</p>
            <p> If, for example, your film brings images
              into the page: you need to have
              a mental model of what those images
              might be, where they are stored, and
              how they’re retrieved.</p>
            <p> <strong>Procedural storytelling</strong> refers to a
              way of designing stories so they’re different
              every time. Procedural storytellers
              write the rules once and trust
              a computer to actually execute the
              story. Modern videogames are procedural
              stories, in that they respond to
              player actions. Madlibs are a kind of
              procedural story, in that a Madlib will
              be different each time it is completed
              by a new person.</p>
          </div>
          <p> It may help to sketch out storyboards, wireframes, or stage directions
            for how you want people to experience your story. Try to describe how it
            should work, not how you’d build it.</p>
          <p> You shouldn’t worry too much about technology at this stage—your creative
            vision will determine the technical requirements. Just think big and figure out how to build it in the next step.</p>
          <h3>Tech</h3>
          <p> Once you have a story and vision, you’ll be able to investigate what kind of
            technology you need to make your vision come alive. The advantage of developing
            a vision first is that you’ll know exactly what technical challenges
            you’ll need to solve to make your vision work.</p>
          <p> Everyone’s technology needs will be different. You’ll need to do some investigation
            around possible solutions— perhaps by searching the web, or
            consulting with a developer, or emailing the creator of a similar project for
            advice.</p>
          <p> If you can at all avoid it, don’t waste your time writing code. The beauty
            of open source is that often, someone has already solved your problem.
            It’s much smarter to spend time repurposing and mashing together code,
            rather than starting from scratch.</p>
          <p> Don’t include technical components just because they’re shiny and cool: the
            tech needs to serve the project’s goals.</p>
          <h3>Rinse and Repeat!</h3>
          <p> After you’ve cycled through story, then vision, then tech—you’ll want to
            come back to story.</p>
          <p> Maybe your idea of the story has changed along the way. Or maybe you
            think that the technology isn’t there to support your vision, and need to
            revisit whether this is the best story to develop for the web. Be brave and
            not afraid to iterate on your work — it’s part of what makes an excellent
            storyteller.</p>
          <h3>Show your work</h3>
          <p> There are some differences between web-native storytellers and conventional
            storytellers. Many storytellers are afraid of showing things that are
            half done. Filmmakers, for instance, do a lot of iteration on their projects,
            but it usually happens in private—they continue to tighten their edit to
            test the flow, tempo, and rhythm of a certain cut. But to adapt to the web,
            filmmakers have to be willing to do this kind of iteration in public.</p>
          <p> As a web-native storyteller, you’re necessarily making software. And in the
            software world, we like to say “if you’re not embarrassed when you ship
            your first version, you waited too long.” </p>
          <p> The best way to tackle a web-native project is to release early, release
            often and iterate on your ideas constantly. Using a cyclical model might
            mean your project may never be finished, but you can be sure it will be
            awesome. Like Da Vinci said, “Art is never finished, it’s only abandoned.”</p>
      
            <h3>In summary</h3>
            <p> Start with a story—an actual story
              about actual people and their motivations.
              Then have a vision for how you
              can tell that story more effectively
              using the web. Then, and only then,
              figure out the specific technologies
              you will use to implement this vision.
              This way, you’ll be in a position to
              make technology work for you—and
              not be stuck asking “what can I do
              with technology?”</p>
